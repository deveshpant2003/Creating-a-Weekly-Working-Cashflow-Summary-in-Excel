# Creating-a-Weekly-Working-Cashflow-Summary-in-Excel
In this repository I have demonstrated how one can create a weekly working cashflow summary for an organization in Excel using the data regarding cash inflows and outflows along with closing balance after all the income realized and expenses paid off. The weeks in which the expenses are more than income have been highlighted in red. I have mentioned gross amounts for every header and prepared cashflow at net amounts. I have derived all the answers via formulae.No formulae are hardcoded.
